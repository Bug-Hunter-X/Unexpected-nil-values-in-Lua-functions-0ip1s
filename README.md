This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua programming related to the handling of `nil` values.  Lua's dynamic typing system doesn't throw errors for `nil` arguments unless explicitly checked. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. The example shows how to correctly check for and handle `nil` to prevent such issues. The `bug.lua` file demonstrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.lua` provides a corrected version.
